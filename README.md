This repository involves building a simple K-Nearest Neighbors classifier using the Iris dataset and scikit learn, and then visualizing the results with [Plotly Dash](https://plot.ly/dash). The lecture is intended for students with some introductory knowledge of data science (i.e., you understand simple classification and can read a confusion matrix).
